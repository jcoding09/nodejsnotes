# Topic 000: NodeJS intro, File-Folder structure, package.json & package-lock.json, Dependency

![NodeJS Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)
Sure, let's start with an introduction to Node.js and then dive into the common file-folder structure, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and handling dependencies.

## Node.js Introduction

### Overview

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance network applications.

### Key Features

- **Non-blocking I/O**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
- **Single-Threaded Event Loop**: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js handles many connections simultaneously through its event loop, making it highly scalable.
- **Package Ecosystem (npm)**: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries managed through npm (Node Package Manager).

### Common Use Cases

- Web servers and APIs
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, gaming servers)
- Microservices architecture
- Command-line tools

## File-Folder Structure

When setting up a Node.js project, organizing your files and folders in a logical manner is crucial for maintainability and scalability. Here’s a typical structure:

```
my-node-app/
│
├── node_modules/   # Installed dependencies
├── public/         # Static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
├── src/            # Source code
│   ├── controllers/  # Controller files (handling business logic)
│   ├── models/       # Database models (e.g., Mongoose schemas)
│   ├── routes/       # Route definitions
│   ├── services/     # Service files (e.g., third-party integrations)
│   └── app.js        # Main application setup
│
├── tests/          # Test files
├── .env            # Environment variables
├── .gitignore      # Git ignore file
├── package.json    # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json # Exact versions of installed dependencies
├── README.md       # Project documentation
└── server.js       # Entry point to the application
```

## `package.json` & `package-lock.json`

### `package.json`

The `package.json` file is a critical part of any Node.js project. It holds various metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, versioning, and other configurations.

### Key Sections

- **name**: The name of the project.
- **version**: The current version of the project.
- **description**: A short description of the project.
- **main**: The entry point of the application (e.g., `server.js`).
- **scripts**: Scripts to run various commands (e.g., start, test).
- **dependencies**: Packages required for the project to run.
- **devDependencies**: Packages required only for development and testing.

### Example `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample Node.js application",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "test": "mocha"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.12.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "^8.3.2",
    "chai": "^4.3.4"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when dependencies are installed or updated. It records the exact versions of every installed package, ensuring that the same versions are installed in the future, thus providing consistency across different environments.

### Importance

- **Exact Dependency Versions**: Ensures that the exact versions of dependencies are installed, avoiding the issues that might arise from version mismatches.
- **Security**: Helps in auditing and securing the project by keeping track of the dependency tree.

### Example `package-lock.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "requires": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.17.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.17.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-...",
      "requires": {
        "accepts": "~1.3.7"
        // other dependencies
      }
    }
    // other dependencies
  }
}
```

## Dependency Management

### Installing Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed using npm or yarn. Here’s how you can install a package:

```bash
npm install <package-name> --save        # Adds to dependencies
npm install <package-name> --save-dev    # Adds to devDependencies
```

### Example of Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install express mongoose --save
npm install mocha chai --save-dev
```

### Requiring Dependencies in Your Code

After installing the dependencies, you can use them in your application by requiring them.

### Example

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const app = express();

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

Node.js is a versatile and powerful platform for server-side development. By understanding the file-folder structure, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and dependency management, you can effectively organize and manage your Node.js projects. This foundational knowledge is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.
