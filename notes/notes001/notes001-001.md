# Topic 001: express, cors, body parser packages

## Express

### Overview

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for Node.js and is known for its simplicity and performance.

### Key Features

- **Routing**: Express provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URL paths.
- **Middleware**: Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the server. Middleware can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.
- **Templating**: Express supports various templating engines (like Pug, EJS, Handlebars) to generate HTML dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Express has a built-in error-handling mechanism that allows you to handle errors in a centralized place.
- **Static Files**: It provides a middleware to serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

### Overview

CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers to control how resources on a web page can be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. The `cors` package for Express is a middleware that enables CORS with various options.

### Key Features

- **Simple Configuration**: Allows you to easily enable CORS with various configurations.
- **Pre-Flight Requests**: Manages pre-flight requests automatically.
- **Custom Headers**: Allows you to specify custom headers to be exposed.
- **Credentialed Requests**: Supports sending credentials like cookies and HTTP authentication.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const app = express();

app.use(cors());

app.get("/data", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "This is CORS-enabled for all origins!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: "http://example.com",
  methods: "GET,POST",
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 204,
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

## Body-Parser

### Overview

Body-Parser is a middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property. It parses incoming request bodies in a middleware and makes the parsed data available on `req.body`.

### Key Features

- **JSON Parsing**: Parses `application/json` type bodies.
- **URL-Encoded Data Parsing**: Parses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` type bodies.
- **Raw and Text Parsing**: Can parse `application/octet-stream` and `text/plain` type bodies.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.send("Data received");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

### Advanced Configuration

```javascript
app.use(
  bodyParser.json({
    limit: "10mb", // Limit the size of the JSON payload
    strict: true, // Only accept arrays and objects
    type: "application/json",
  })
);

app.use(
  bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true, // Use extended syntax for rich objects and arrays
    parameterLimit: 10000, // Limit the number of parameters
  })
);
```

## Conclusion

These three packages—Express, CORS, and Body-Parser—are fundamental for setting up a Node.js server. Express provides the core framework for building server-side applications, CORS middleware enables secure cross-origin requests, and Body-Parser facilitates handling incoming request data. Together, they form a robust foundation for any web application built on Node.js.
