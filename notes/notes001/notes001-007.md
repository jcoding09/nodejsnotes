Topic 007: Difference between require() and import in Node.js

# Topic 007: Difference between require() and import in Node.js

In Node.js, both `require()` and `import` are used to include modules, but they belong to different module systems and have distinct differences.

1. **`require()`**: This function is part of the CommonJS module system, which is the default module system in Node.js. CommonJS modules are synchronous and are typically used in Node.js environments.

2. **`import`**: This statement is part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) module system, also known as ECMAScript modules (ESM). ESM modules are asynchronous and are the standard for JavaScript modules in modern environments, including browsers and Node.js (starting from version 12 with the `--experimental-modules` flag, and natively in later versions).

### Using `require()`

Here's an example of how to use `require()`:

**moduleA.js**

```javascript
module.exports = function () {
  console.log("Hello from moduleA");
};
```

**main.js**

```javascript
const moduleA = require("./moduleA");
moduleA();
```

### Using `import`

Here's the equivalent example using `import`:

**moduleA.mjs**

```javascript
export function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from moduleA");
}
```

**main.mjs**

```javascript
import { greet } from "./moduleA.mjs";
greet();
```

### Key Differences

1. **Syntax**:

   - `require()`: `const module = require('module');`
   - `import`: `import { something } from 'module';`

2. **Default vs Named Exports**:

   - With `require()`, you typically export a single entity using `module.exports`, and import it with `const something = require('./module');`.
   - With `import`, you can export multiple named entities and import them selectively: `export const foo = ...;`, `import { foo } from './module';`.

3. **Dynamic Loading**:

   - `require()` can be called conditionally, allowing for dynamic loading of modules.
     ```javascript
     if (condition) {
       const moduleA = require("./moduleA");
       moduleA();
     }
     ```
   - `import` statements are static and must be declared at the top level of the file. However, dynamic imports can be done using `import()` function.
     ```javascript
     if (condition) {
       import("./moduleA").then((moduleA) => {
         moduleA.greet();
       });
     }
     ```

4. **Execution Context**:

   - CommonJS modules (`require()`) are executed in the scope of their own file, allowing for private variables and functions.
   - ES Modules (`import`) are executed in strict mode and support top-level `this` binding to `undefined`.

5. **Compatibility**:

   - `require()` is fully supported in Node.js for all versions.
   - `import` is supported in Node.js from version 12.0.0 with a flag and natively from version 13.2.0 without the flag. It is also widely supported in modern browsers.

6. **File Extensions**:
   - By default, `.js` files are treated as CommonJS modules and `.mjs` files as ES modules in Node.js.
   - You can use a `package.json` with a `"type": "module"` field to indicate that `.js` files should be treated as ES modules.

### Example with `package.json`

**package.json**

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

**moduleA.js**

```javascript
export function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from moduleA");
}
```

**main.js**

```javascript
import { greet } from "./moduleA.js";
greet();
```

By setting `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, `.js` files are interpreted as ES modules, allowing you to use `import`/`export` syntax directly without needing the `.mjs` extension.
