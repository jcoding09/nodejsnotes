# Topic 021: Node.js: A Step-by-Step Guide to Handling Asynchronous JWT Verification

---

### Introduction

When working with asynchronous functions in JavaScript, especially in Node.js, handling callbacks can become challenging. A common scenario is using `jwt.verify` to decode tokens. Without properly handling asynchronous behavior, you might encounter issues like `undefined` being returned, even though you're expecting a valid decoded token.

In this guide, we will explore how to handle such cases using `async/await` with `jwt.verify`, ensuring that your code runs in sequence and provides the expected results.

### Common Issue: `await` Not Working with `jwt.verify`

In an asynchronous function, you might try using `await` on a function like `jwt.verify`, expecting the token to be decoded and returned. However, `jwt.verify` uses a callback-based API. This means that without properly handling the callback, the return value could be `undefined`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here’s an example of what can go wrong:

```javascript
export const onLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const userId = await validateToken(api, event); // Attempt to await result
  console.log("User ID:", userId); // Unexpectedly logs `undefined`
};
```

In this case, the function `validateToken` is not returning the decoded token correctly because `jwt.verify`'s callback isn't being awaited properly. Let's see how we can fix this.

### Solution: Wrapping `jwt.verify` in a Promise

Since `jwt.verify` uses a callback, you can wrap it inside a `Promise` to make it compatible with `async/await`. This allows you to handle the result (or error) in a sequential manner.

#### Example:

Here’s how you can refactor your `validateToken` function to work with `async/await`:

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken"); // Assuming you're using jsonwebtoken

async function validateToken(api, event) {
  const idToken = api.idToken;
  const getKey = api.getKey;
  const audience = "your_audience";
  const issuer = "your_issuer";
  const algorithms = ["RS256"];

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    jwt.verify(idToken, getKey, { audience, issuer, algorithms }, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) {
        return reject(err); // Handle errors
      }
      resolve(decoded); // Return the decoded token
    });
  });
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Promise Wrapper**: We wrap `jwt.verify` inside a `Promise`. If the verification is successful, the promise resolves with the decoded token. Otherwise, it rejects with an error.
2. **async/await**: By returning a `Promise`, you can now use `await` to pause execution until the promise resolves, ensuring sequential execution.

### Usage Example in `onLogin` Function

Now that `validateToken` returns a `Promise`, you can use `await` in your `onLogin` function to ensure the token is decoded before moving on.

```javascript
export const onLogin = async (event, api) => {
  try {
    const decodedToken = await validateToken(api, event); // Wait for token verification
    console.log("Decoded Token:", decodedToken); // Successfully prints decoded token
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error verifying token:", error); // Handle any errors
  }
};
```

### What This Does:

- **Sequential Execution**: The `await` ensures that the token is decoded before moving to the next line.
- **Error Handling**: Any errors during the token verification process are caught and handled properly.
- **Clean, Readable Code**: Using `async/await` improves code readability and reduces callback complexity.
